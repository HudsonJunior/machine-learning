# Machine Learning Semester Project

This repository contains projects and assignments from a semester-long **Machine Learning** subject, focusing on hands-on exploration of machine learning principles with **Python**. Key components include:

- **Data Analysis**: Preprocessing techniques and data exploration for meaningful insights.
- **Model Implementation**: Building and training models for tasks like classification and regression.

This project was designed to strengthen my understanding of core machine learning workflows and Python-based modeling.
